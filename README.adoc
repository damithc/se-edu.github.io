This GitHub organization is a collection of *FOSS* resources for Software Engineering educators and students. In particular, it aims to provide sample code bases that are bigger in size and non-trivial in complexity.

== Sub Projects

These are some of the sub projects (come with code, learning outcomes, exercises, etc.)

=== Project: AddressBook

A series of Java projects with increasing size and complexity, to be used as examples (or starter projects) in SE courses.

* https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level1[*Level 1*] [1 KLoC] : Non-OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
* https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level2[*Level 2*] [2 KLoC] : OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
* https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level3[*Level 3*] [3 KLoC] : Simple GUI with text input and output
* https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4[*Level 4*] [6 KLoC] : Better GUI and more features
* *Levels 5, 6, ...* (Coming soon)

=== Book: Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners
